programming language targeted at the z80 processor, and in particular
at the ZX Spectrum computer. nAda is written in Prolog.

Current version

No version yet as it still does nothing.

Documentation
-------------

Nothing yet.

Installation
------------

Currently the project is just a set of files, so just load them in
your Prolog environment and play with them.

The current development environment is SWI-Prolog version 5.10.4. It
is very likely that it also works in any other recent version of
SWI-Prolog (i.e. > 5.6). You can get the SWI-Prolog environment at:

http://www.swi-prolog.org/

Other Prolog systems may or may not work. I don't go out of my way to
keep it standard ISO Prolog.
